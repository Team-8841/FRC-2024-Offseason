# Team 8841's 2024 Offseason

This repo contains some code that we're writing for the 2024 offseason. I'm not really sure what to write here tbh. Trans rights are human rights.

## Documentation

To generate the javadocs run `./gradlew generateDocs` in the root directory of the project. The generated documentation should be put into `build/docs`.
